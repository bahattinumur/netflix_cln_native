<h1>NETFLIX CLONE APP</h1>

I have developed a Netflix clone application using React Native, leveraging the UI design inspired by Netflix and fetching data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. The app incorporates essential features such as navigation, state management with Redux, and smooth transitions using a variety of popular libraries like React Navigation, Axios, and React Native Snap Carousel. It provides a seamless user experience, optimized for both Android and iOS, with a responsive layout styled with NativeWind and TailwindCSS.
